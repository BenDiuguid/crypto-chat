## Set up

Download [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) Probably the LTS (Long Term Stable) is best.

Then clone this repo, and run `npm install` twice, once in the `client/` directory, and once in the `server/` directory.

If you receive no errors you're good to move on, if you have errors, ask Ben. (NOTE: npm/node must be on your path.)

Then run `npm run dev` in the `server/` folder to start the server in "development" mode which will restart the server when files change.

Then run `npm run start` in the `client/` folder to start the client in "development" mode which will restart the client when files change.
